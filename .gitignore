# We want to rely on the requirements.yml file for listing the roles
# but some of the roles are not public or are project specific that
# they are co-hosted with the project. 
# The following lines ensure we only track roles which name starts
# by `project-`, ignoring all the other roles

ansible/roles/*
!ansible/roles/project-*
